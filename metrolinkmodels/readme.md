# Metrolink OO/HO Scale 3D Models
This folder holds the OpenSCAD versions of 3D models I have created for my OO/HO Scale Metrolink Diorama

- shelter-v7.scad - this contains switchable code to generate platform, shelter, ramps and ticket machines - use the PRINTXXX variables at the start of the file to control what is generated in the STL.  Platform height is set to match the Halling OO Scale M5000 tram set on standard Hornby OO/HO Scale Track on Sleepers.
