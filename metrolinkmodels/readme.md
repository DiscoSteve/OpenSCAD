# Metrolink OO/HO Scale 3D Models
This folder holds the OpenSCAD versions of 3D models I have created for my OO/HO Scale Metrolink Diorama

shelter-v7.scad - this contains switchable code to generate platfort, shelter, ramps and ticket machines - use the PRINTXXX variables at the start of the file to control what is generated in the STL
