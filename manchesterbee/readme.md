# OpenSCAD Manchester Bee In The City

This is my micro model of the Manchester Bee in the City statues that are currently being displayed in and around Manchester UK during the summer of 2018.

This has been reverse-engineered from photographs and built almost entirely from geometric shapes in OpenScad - only the abdomen is formed from an extruded mesh.

Two versions exist - a full single colour bee on a mount (micro-bee-in-the-city-v3-fixed.stl) and a version split into two so that the bee can be printed in a different colour to the mount (micro-bee-in-the-city-v3-bee-footblocks.stl and micro-bee-in-the-city-v2-base-fixed.stl)

This needs to be printed with supports. The mouth part of the head needs to be printed slowly and with care.

NOTE; This model was created independently and is NOT associated with the Manchester Bee In The City promotion in any way, I created it purely to allow people to produce their own table top version (since the official team strangely do not offer one)
