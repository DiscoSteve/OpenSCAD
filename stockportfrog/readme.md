# OpenSCAD - Stockport's Giant Leap Frog

This is my micro model of the Stockport's "Giant Leap" Frog statues that are being displayed in and around Stockport UK during the summer of 2019.

This has been reverse-engineered from photographs and built entirely from geometric shapes in OpenScad.

***UPDATED to include the Lily Pad that the Real Frogs are all sat on in the streets of Stockport. Three models available, first with frog and lilypad, and the 2nd and 3rd fro and lilypad separate so you can print them difference colours.

NOTE; This model was created independently by me and is NOT associated with the Stockport's Giant Leap promotion in any way, I created it purely to allow people to produce their own table top version

See https://stockportsgiantleap.co.uk/ for info on the real Frogs
